# Quantum Machine Learning for High-Energy Physics (QMLHEL) Tasks 2025

The following GitHub repository contains tasks for my evaluation as a mentee for **Google Summer of Code 2025** under the **ML4SCI QMLHEP** organization:

## Task 1: Quantum Circuits
Two simple quantum circuits were constructed using basic gates such as Hadamard, CNOT, Rotations, and SWAP. These circuits were implemented using Cirq.

## Task 2: Classical Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
Two graphical neural networks, namely GCNs (Graph Convolutional Networks) and GATs (Graph Attention Networks), were used for jet classification into quarks or gluons.

## Task 3: Open Task
This task involved sharing my experience and insights on quantum computing and discussing a quantum algorithm I am familiar with.

## Task 6: Contrastive Learning
This task involved creating an adaptation of a Siamese network I trained on contrastive learning, to take two images from the MNIST dataset, generates their quantum embeddings using a quantum circuit with learnable weights and maps them into an embedding space where similar images are placed together, while dissimilar images are placed farther apart.

## Task 9: Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (QKANs)
This task involved first creating classical KAN trained on the MNIST dataset and then discussing possible extension of these models to the quantum domain.
